In carrying out this project two main models for analysis were used and a decription of the two models are as follows.
Vader and RoBERTa are two popular models used in sentiment analysis.

The Vader model is a rule-based model that utilizes a lexicon of words and their sentiment scores to determine the overall sentiment of a text. The model considers not only the words themselves but also their context, which allows it to detect sarcasm and negation. The Vader model outputs a sentiment score between -1 and 1 for a given text, where -1 indicates extremely negative sentiment and 1 indicates extremely positive sentiment.

On the other hand, RoBERTa is a neural network-based language model that utilizes a transformer architecture. Unlike Vader, RoBERTa doesn't rely on a pre-defined lexicon of sentiment scores. Instead, it learns to extract sentiment from text through training on a large amount of data. RoBERTa has shown remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis.

In conclusion, while the Vader model is a simple and effective rule-based model, RoBERTa is a more complex and powerful neural network-based model that requires large amounts of training data. Both models have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which to use ultimately depends on the specific needs of a project.
